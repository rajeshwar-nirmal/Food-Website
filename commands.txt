we have to register our model and app before makemigrations
for registering the app.. copy the classname from apps.py (Homeconfig) then go in settings and paste in installed apps
like ['home.apps.Homeconfig'],   (dont forget to put comma after that)

perform makemigrations
*after these steps it will create the model Contact(same as class name)
perform migrate
* this will create Contact model in database

we can add the data in Contact model from database but we want to do it from the website

//makemigrations =  create changes and store in a file
//migrate = apply the pending changes created by makemigratiions     ...(write in a database)
